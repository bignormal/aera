This directory defines the high-level concepts, business logic, and architecture of this project using markdown. It is managed by [lat.md](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lat.md) — a tool that anchors source code to these definitions. Install the `lat` command with `npm i -g lat.md` and run `lat --help`.

> **Hermes One** is a community-maintained project. This desktop app is a wrapper around **Hermes Agent** — it is **not affiliated with, endorsed by, or supported by Nous Research**. "Hermes One" is the name of this community project; "Hermes"/"Hermes Agent" refer to the upstream agent it builds on.

- [[chat-commands]] — how typed slash commands are routed through the gateway's `slash.exec`/`command.dispatch` pipeline instead of being sent as prompt text.
- [[chat-performance]] — how chat rendering stays responsive through contained transcript rows, batched textarea resizing, and fixed-row slash-command virtualization.
- [[model-context]] — the per-model context-window override that drives the context gauge and the agent's auto-compaction.
- [[model-selection]] — the session-scoped in-chat model override that switches the model (and provider) for one conversation without touching the global default.
- [[web-preview]] — the in-app split-screen webview and the `partition`-based gate that lets only it load remote HTTPS while staying sandboxed.
- [[code-blocks]] — collapsible long code blocks, and why expansion state is keyed on source position to survive react-markdown's streaming remounts.
- [[window-chrome]] — the browser-style title bar where open-conversation tabs sit on top of the window drag region, clickable while empty space still drags.
- [[desktop-updates]] — GitHub release checks, startup upgrade button behavior, and the Settings auto-upgrade preference.
- [[agentera-branding]] — the Aera product identity, visible naming rules, icon contract, and retained internal compatibility boundary.
- [[system-locale]] — first-use operating-system language selection, locale normalization, and saved-preference precedence.
- [[agentera-self-evolution]] — the release-blocking Hermes compatibility rule, local self-learning boundary, immutable Agent versions, and explicit candidate-promotion path.
- [[multi-agent-memory]] — per-Agent identity and private Hermes learning, the account-wide behavior profile, and durable conversation snapshot rules.
- [[agentera-runtime-distribution]] — the signed platform-specific Runtime seed, offline first installation, user-confirmed updates, rollback, and Profile-data isolation.
- [[agentera-app-authentication]] — the independent AgentEra APP account gate, browser PKCE flow, device-bound offline entitlement, and existing-Profile ownership rules.
- [[agentera-desktop-control]] — authenticated Desktop heartbeat, fixed health checks, idempotent result delivery, and the renderer privacy boundary used by internal fleet operations.
- [[agentera-agent-control-plane]] — USER-owned local Agent drafts, immutable stable-version publication, per-device Agent installation, and conversation-scoped RuntimeBinding rules.
- [[beta27-reliability-plan]] — approved Beta.27 reliability boundaries and isolated acceptance evidence; planned behavior is not a release claim.
- [[agentera-post-official-delivery]] — the approved content-free official quality pipeline, client-encrypted Profile backup, cross-device restore, and production release gates.
- [[agentera-workspaces]] — fixed-owner Workspace lifecycle, memberships, one-time invitations, desktop context switching, and offline read-only boundaries.
- [[agentera-organizations]] — transferable enterprise ownership, Organization roles and Departments, signed policy snapshots, audit, product-context switching, and Hermes isolation.
- [[sidebar-navigation]] — the recent-sessions list under the Chat nav item, capped at five with a "Show more" button that opens the full session list in a modal.
- [[context-folder]] — the per-session linked working folder, persisted in a desktop-owned state.db table so a re-opened conversation restores its folder.
- [[main-process]] — the Electron main-process entrypoint, app lifecycle modules, and centralized IPC registry.
- [[remote-dashboard-oauth]] — direct Remote dashboard browser authentication, main-process cookie isolation, and single-use WebSocket ticket handling.
- [[provider-setup]] — the first-run provider picker; its top grid mirrors the agent's native `CANONICAL_PROVIDERS` while OpenAI-compatible endpoints route through the Local presets.
- [[legacy-model-config-migration]] — automatic migration of pre-Beta.27 scalar `model:` format to mapping format, preventing duplicate-key YAML errors and native_route stage failures.
- [[image-generation]] — Profile-default conversation image generation, independent relay credentials, paid-call boundaries, and Runtime refresh behavior.
- [[hermes-account-login]] — desktop sign-in to a Hermes account via the RFC 8628 device grant; secure token storage, IPC, and the Providers-screen entry point.
- [[agent-sync]] — transitional bidirectional sync of desktop profiles with cloud agents for persona, color, and model/provider; private `MEMORY.md` and `USER.md` are excluded.
- [[kanban]] — the JIRA-style multi-agent board tab; a thin client over the `hermes kanban` CLI with canonical status columns, an archived toggle, and focus/poll refresh.
- [[analytics]] — privacy-first, opt-out usage analytics that POST anonymous events to the in-house Hermes analytics service, keyed by a per-install localStorage UUID; replaces the former PostHog integration.
- [[wallet-token-balances]] — profile-scoped Base mainnet wallets with encrypted recovery phrases, and on-chain ERC-20 token balance reads via ethers v6.
- [[office-3d-traffic]] — the Office tab's backdrop traffic: car-following and junction-yielding simulation, per-model nose orientation, and instanced fleet rendering in a dozen draw calls.
- [[office-3d-interiors]] — enterable office/bank/showroom interiors: per-location conditional mounting (city unmounts while indoors), camera fly-in rig, interactable objects (ATM → wallet, desk → agent, car → spec card), and idle-agent walking trips between buildings.
- [[office-interactions]] — space representatives: interactive bank tellers whose menu runs account status, balances, and account creation against the hermes-one backend for a chosen agent; the extensible pattern for future spaces (showroom sales, building space).
