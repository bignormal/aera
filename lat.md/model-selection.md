# Session model override

The in-chat (bottom) model picker selects a model for the **current conversation only** — it never rewrites `config.yaml`, so the Settings global default is preserved (#688), and carries the full model identity so cross-provider switches route correctly.

The override is held in renderer state on each `<Chat>` run ([[src/renderer/src/screens/Chat/Chat.tsx]]), persisted by session id, and sent with every message; it is cleared when the conversation is cleared/reset and is absent on a fresh chat, so new conversations start on the global default. This is distinct from the persisted [[model-context]] default that non-chat surfaces read.

Settings → Models uses a different path: each service card in [[src/renderer/src/screens/Providers/ModelCenter.tsx#ModelCenter]] has a default-model selector that immediately calls `setModelConfig` with the full provider, model, and Base URL identity. That selection changes the global default for future conversations; it never mutates an active chat's session override.

## Two-pane picker grouped by display brand

The bottom [[src/renderer/src/screens/Chat/ModelPicker.tsx]] dropdown is a two-pane layout: a left **provider rail** filters a right **flat model list**, with a top search box narrowing both.

The rail has an "All models" entry plus one row per brand (logo + model count); each list row shows the model title, a `Provider · model-id` subtitle, and a check on the active model. The currently-selected model is sorted **first** within whatever filter is shown (exact provider+model+baseUrl match, then same provider+model), leaving the rest of the list in its original order.

Models are grouped by **display brand**, not the raw stored provider, so OpenAI-compatible providers persisted as `custom` (Hermes One, Groq, DeepSeek, …) get their own rail entry instead of one generic "OpenAI Compatible / Local" bucket. [[src/renderer/src/screens/Chat/hooks/useModelConfig.ts#groupModelsByProvider]] derives each group's key/label from [[src/renderer/src/constants.ts#displayBrandFromConfig]], which reverse-maps a `custom` model's `baseUrl` to a brand id via `OPENAI_COMPATIBLE_BASE_URLS` (same reverse-map the [[provider-setup]] active-model picker uses). A `custom` endpoint not in the map stays under "OpenAI Compatible / Local".

The global model library is not itself proof that a named custom provider is still configured for the current Profile. Before grouping, [[src/renderer/src/screens/Chat/hooks/useModelConfig.ts#availableModelsForProfile]] intersects custom attachments with that Profile's live `providers.json` identities. Removed providers disappear on `onCustomProvidersChanged`; endpoint-preserving renames are canonicalized to the current name instead of resurrecting an obsolete `custom:<name>` route. Built-in provider entries are unaffected.

Crucially, each model row keeps its **effective** `provider`/`baseUrl` for selection — only the rail grouping/label is branded. Built-in rows retain their stored route; a named custom row is canonicalized to the current Profile provider identity described above. The rail brand filter is display-only React state; picking "All models" or a brand never rewrites config. The rail logo is the brand's [[src/renderer/src/components/common/BrandLogo.tsx]] (`matchTheme`), with a generic fallback for unknown brands.

A **Configure** button is pinned at the bottom of the provider rail (below the scrollable brand list), replacing the old free-text model input: it closes the picker and dispatches the `navigation:goto` window event (detail `"providers"`). [[src/renderer/src/screens/Layout/Layout.tsx]] keeps that event compatible but now opens **Settings → Providers**, the single surface for managing keys and the model library.

## Full identity, not just the model name

The override is a `SessionModelOverride` (`{provider, model, baseUrl}`), not a bare model string — because switching across providers must change routing, not only the `model` field.

## Installed-Agent route selection uses an owner catalog

An installed Agent's model picker reads the same Main-owned catalog as Providers, while the selected opaque route is revalidated before installation or repair.

The catalog selection carries `sourceProfileId`, `modelLibraryId`, and `catalogRevision`; renderer code never receives a credential reference or Profile path. A route saved on an active installed Profile remains visible beside account routes, and a Beta.26 pending operation is converted through a fresh catalog snapshot before another write. A stale revision produces localized retry guidance instead of “please configure a model.”

The picker builds it via [[src/renderer/src/screens/Chat/hooks/useModelConfig.ts#effectiveOverrideBaseUrl]], the same baseUrl rule `selectModel` applies (keep the URL only for `custom`/`ollama-cloud`; clear it for named providers that have a canonical base URL), so the session pick and a persisted save can't drift. It is threaded renderer → preload IPC → main `sendMessage` as `modelOverride`.

## Installed-Agent switch policy and immutable resume

Installed-Agent model changes use a Main-resolved route and a new immutable RuntimeBinding; an existing segment is validated and reused without route mutation.

### Policy intersection and bounded denials

[[src/main/agentera-agent-control/model-policy.ts#decideAgentModelRoute]] applies the signed Manifest policy and effective tenant policy independently. `fixed` rejects a real switch, while allowlist provider/model failures keep distinct bounded codes; `custom` permits a configured `custom:<name>` route.

### Candidate route versus current segment

[[src/main/agentera-agent-control/hermes-adapter.ts#AgenteraHermesAdapter#prepareInstalledTurnPlan]] freezes only a same-turn [[src/main/agentera-agent-control/owner-model-route-catalog.ts#ResolvedOwnerModelRoute]] for a candidate. An identical full route reuses the active Binding, while a different route keeps the old Binding immutable and targets the Main-derived segment key.

### Current full-route and legacy validation

A current full route must still resolve to the exact source Profile/model row and usable credential before resume. Exact Beta.26 three-field routes skip unavailable source metadata checks but still pass signed Manifest and tenant policy checks.

### Manager thread adoption and candidate preparation

[[src/main/agentera-agent-control/manager.ts#AgenteraAgentControlManager#prepareConversationRuntime]] adopts the first verified binding, resolves opaque selections in Main, reuses an identical route, and leaves a different route `preparing`.

If durable candidate finalization fails, Main marks that candidate `failed`, preserves the prior active Segment, and permits a later retry.

### Send initialization failure boundary

A candidate must leave `preparing` when any pre-output send initialization fails.

[[src/main/ipc/agent-model-send.ts#runAgentModelSegmentPreflight]] emits the preparing event and fails the candidate when local Gateway startup or SSH tunnel preparation rejects. Execution-lease creation and synchronous transport setup use the same idempotent lifecycle fallback in [[src/main/ipc/register.ts#registerIpcHandlers]], so the old active Segment remains authoritative and the user can retry the switch.

### Policy-filtered staged selection

[[src/renderer/src/screens/Chat/ModelPicker.tsx#ModelPicker]] uses the installed Agent catalog instead of ordinary model groups, disables fixed or in-flight switches, and stages only the opaque selection for the next send without writing a session override.

### Authoritative resume context

[[src/renderer/src/screens/Chat/Chat.tsx#Chat]] waits for Main's conversation context before restoring an ordinary session override and retains the last verified Agent route while a refresh is pending, preventing model-picker flicker or cross-path persistence.

### Main-acknowledged local marker

[[src/renderer/src/screens/Chat/chatMessages.ts#insertModelSwitchMarker]] inserts and deduplicates a renderer-only marker only after an `active` segment event. The marker is excluded from prompts and transcript export, while duplicate events cannot advance the visible ordinal twice.

### Cold resume projects the active segment

Session history presents one Agent thread even though each accepted model switch owns a separate immutable Hermes session.

[[src/main/agentera-agent-control/conversation-thread-session-projection.ts#projectSessionSummaries]] replaces activated segment rows with the active session summary and leaves ordinary sessions unchanged. Resuming any known segment first resolves the active session through Main, then [[src/renderer/src/screens/Chat/sessionHistory.ts#buildConversationThreadResume]] restores its history and local switch markers.

### Whole-thread cleanup

Deleting one projected Agent session expands to every attached Hermes segment before owner-scoped control metadata is removed.

[[src/main/ipc/conversation-session-deletion.ts#deleteConversationSessions]] preserves metadata when Hermes deletion fails or its local database is unavailable, and stops before boundary cleanup if thread cleanup conflicts.

### Dynamic Runtime route capability

Cross-provider and cross-endpoint Agent switches stay fail-closed until Runtime advertises the exact request-scoped route contract.

[[src/main/hermes.ts#supportsHermesAgentModelRoute]] requires `request_model_route` plus `/v1/chat/completions`; [[src/main/hermes.ts#buildAgentModelRequestBody]] adds the short-lived `aera_model_route` only for a Main-approved dynamic execution lease. Unsupported Runtime versions return `model_switch_runtime_route_unsupported` without replaying the prompt.

## Desktop-only persistence

The selected model/provider is saved in a desktop-owned table keyed by session id, without storing API keys.

[[src/main/session-model-override-store.ts]] holds `desktop_session_model_overrides` with `provider`, `model`, and `base_url` only. [[src/renderer/src/screens/Chat/Chat.tsx#Chat]] restores the saved value for a resumed session, applies it to the local picker with `persist:false`, and saves later changes once a gateway session id exists. Deleting a session removes the row through [[src/main/sessions.ts#deleteSessionRows]].

## Text-only legacy fallback routes via CLI

Text-only legacy turns can use the CLI fallback when a session override changes provider or base URL away from `config.yaml`.

The upstream desktop model applies the session switch on the active gateway session with `/model <model> --provider <provider>`, then attaches media and submits on that same session. Hermes Desktop's dashboard transport follows that path; [[src/main/hermes.ts#shouldForceCliForSessionOverride]] keeps the CLI escape hatch only for text-only legacy fallback, where it can pass `-m <model>` and `--provider` without dropping attachments. Same-provider model swaps stay on the gateway/API path, where the new `model` string is sufficient. Remote (SSH) mode has no local CLI transport, so it remains limited to the model string.

## Attachment turns stay on session transport

Attachment turns must not be forced through the CLI override fallback because the CLI path cannot carry multimodal input.

[[src/main/hermes.ts#sendMessageViaCli]] can inline text-file attachments but ignores images, while the gateway/API path preserves image parts and path refs through [[src/main/hermes.ts#buildUserContent]]. When a session override is active and the user sends attachments, [[src/main/hermes.ts#shouldForceCliForSessionOverride]] leaves the turn eligible for the dashboard/gateway or API transport instead of silently dropping media.
